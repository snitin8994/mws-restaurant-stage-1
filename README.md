# About the project

I was given a starter file and was tasked with improving 3 things in the project

* Accessibility
* Responsiveness
* Adding Service workers

## My solution

* Open a live server either using VS code live server or you can build live server through Python's http-server
* The main reason for using live server is that service workers do no cache files served from file system
* To improve **Accessibility**
   * I added skip links
   * Converted a link to button
   * Gave aria-label to select tag
   * Inlcuded max-width of 100% for all images and included alt attributes as well
   
* **Responsiveness**
   * Used flex layout
   * Changed timings table layout for viewports below 300px
   * Map changes

* **Service workers**
   * Used service workers to implement caching for offline use
